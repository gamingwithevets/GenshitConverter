# GenshitConverter
Binary formats are hard to read, don't you think? As an effort to remove all traces of Lua, whoever created [this project](https://github.com/telecomadm1145/CasioEmuMsvc) decided to replace all the Lua config files as well.
So we have created *this program* as the solution to converting these binary files back to Lua! **MAY LUA LIVE FOREVER!!!**

To convert the files back to binary, please use lua_config_convert in the same repo linked above.

## Usage
```
main.py [binary config input] [lua config output]
```
